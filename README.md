# Classic Arcade Game Clone

Completing this game was the objective of the 3rd project in
Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.  Students were given
some files and starter code and we had to make changes and add our own code to 
make it a fully functional Frogger type arcade game.  The purpose of 
the game was to introduce students to object oriented javascript and
the html 5 canvas while having us build on code written by other people.


## Main Objective

Using the directional arrows on your keyboard, move the player across the canvas
to the water at the top of the screen without getting hit by a bug.  If you make it to the water 3 times in a row you win but you only get 3 lives.
